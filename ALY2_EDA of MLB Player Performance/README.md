# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Two Data Sets

This repository contains the second R project for the ALY6000 course, which involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on two real-world datasets: the 2015 World Happiness Report and 1986 Major League Baseball (MLB) player statistics. The goal is to extract insights, visualize patterns, and interpret findings that can inform policy or strategic decisions.

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is divided into two main parts:

### Part 1: World Happiness Report 2015
- Analyze global happiness scores, freedom, family support, and other contributing factors.
- Perform descriptive statistics and visualizations (bar charts, histograms, boxplots).
- Compare regional trends and interpret differences.
- Identify key insights about global well-being and potential policy applications.

### Part 2: MLB 1986 Player Statistics
- Explore batting performance metrics such as home runs, RBIs, strikeouts, and more.
- Identify standout players using summary statistics and visualizations.
- Evaluate MVP candidates based on comparative performance against league averages.
- Provide recommendations based on data-driven assessments.

## 🛠 Tools & Packages Used

- **tidyverse**: Data manipulation and visualization
- **janitor**: Data cleaning and exploration
- **ggplot2**: Custom data visualizations
- **readr** and **dplyr**: Data import and manipulation

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "janitor"))
```

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/r-eda-two-datasets.git
cd r-eda-two-datasets
```

### 3. Run the Script
- Open the R script file (e.g., `Elenchezhian_Project2.R`) in RStudio.
- Load both datasets and execute the code step-by-step to view visualizations and summaries.

## 📊 Key Insights
