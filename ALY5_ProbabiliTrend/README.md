# ProbabiliTrend: Analytical Insights through Counting & Probability

## Project Overview

**ProbabiliTrend** is a hands-on analytics project focusing on **combinatorics and probability theory**. Developed as part of the ALY6000: Introduction to Analytics course, this project explores the foundational elements of probability using real-world-inspired problems and quantitative reasoning. It includes both required and challenge sections, offering in-depth analysis and applications.
