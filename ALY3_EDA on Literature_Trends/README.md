# Goodreads Book Data Analysis (1990–2020)

This repository contains Project 3 of the ALY6000: Introduction to Analytics course. The project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of books collected from Goodreads. The goal is to analyze trends in publication, book ratings, author output, and publisher dominance using R programming.

## 📘 Project Overview

The dataset spans books published between 1990 and 2020 and includes variables such as:
- Ratings
- Number of pages
- Publication year
- Publisher
- Author

The analysis applies EDA techniques to uncover insights related to reader preferences, publishing trends, and market concentration.

## 🔍 Key Findings & Visualizations

### 1. ⭐ Rating Distribution
- **Insight:** Most books have ratings between 3.5 and 4.5, indicating a favorable bias.
- **Visualization:** Histogram of ratings.

### 2. 📄 Page Length Distribution
- **Insight:** Median book length is ~350 pages; most books fall below 600 pages.
- **Visualization:** Boxplot of page counts.

### 3. 📈 Publication Trends (1990–2020)
- **Insight:** Steady increase in book publications until early 2010s, then a slight decline.
- **Visualization:** Line plot of books published per year.

### 4. 🏢 Publisher Market Share
- **Insight:** Top 5 publishers account for ~75% of books, indicating market dominance.
- **Visualization:** Pareto chart.

### 5. ✍️ Top Authors

- **Visualization:** Bar chart of top 10 authors by book count.

## 💡 Recommendations

- **Authors:** Write books of moderate length (300–400 pages) to appeal to broader audiences.
- **Publishers:** Diversify content beyond dominant genres and authors.
- **Readers:** Explore independent authors and publishers for unique reads.
- **Future Research:** Examine the impact of e-books and digital publishing post-2020.
