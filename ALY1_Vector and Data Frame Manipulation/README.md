# R Practice Project: Vector and Data Frame Manipulation

This repository contains a comprehensive R programming project that explores fundamental and intermediate concepts such as arithmetic operations, vector manipulation, subsetting, descriptive statistics, and data frame analysis. The project is structured as a sequence of 33 problems, culminating in the analysis of a real-world dataset on data science salaries.

## 📘 Project Overview

The project is designed as a hands-on exercise for building proficiency in the R programming language. It focuses on:

- Creating and manipulating vectors
- Performing logical subsetting and indexing
- Applying built-in statistical functions
- Importing and exploring tabular data using data frames

The capstone task involves importing and summarizing a CSV dataset (`ds_salaries.csv`) to simulate real-world data analysis.

## 🧩 Detailed Breakdown

### 🔹 Part 1: R Fundamentals and Basic Computations
- Arithmetic and logical operations
- Modulus vs division

### 🔹 Part 2: Vector Creation and Manipulation
- Creating vectors with `c()` and `:`
- Generating random vectors with `runif()`
- Using `set.seed()` for reproducibility

### 🔹 Part 3: Vector Operations and Logical Subsetting
- Vectorized operations (addition, multiplication)
- Logical filtering and extraction using indexing
- Negative indexing to exclude elements

### 🔹 Part 4: Descriptive Statistics and Numerical Summaries
- `sum()`, `mean()`, `median()`, `sd()`, `cumsum()`, `round()`, `sort()`
- Applying statistical functions to evaluate numerical vectors

### 🔹 Part 5: Introduction to Data Frames
- Importing CSV using `read.csv()`
- Using `summary()` for column-wise statistics
- Basic inspection of a real-world dataset

## 📁 Dataset

**`ds_salaries.csv`**  
A dataset containing information about salaries in the data science domain, including:
- `work_year`
- `experience_level`
- `job_title`
- `salary`
- `salary_in_usd`

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

To execute this project on your local machine:

### 1. Prerequisites
- Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
- Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/r-vector-dataframe-practice.git
cd r-vector-dataframe-practice
```

### 3. Run the Code
- Open `Elenchezhian_Project1.R` in RStudio.
- Ensure `ds_salaries.csv` is in the same directory.
- Run the script line-by-line or as a whole to see outputs in the R console.
